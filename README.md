Tetris Game in Four Programming Languages
Tetris Game in Four Programming Languages
This repository contains examples of how to create a Tetris game in four different programming languages: C#, JavaScript, Python, and Java. Each implementation follows similar steps: setting up the game board, defining the shapes, creating a falling block, allowing the player to move the block, implementing gravity, checking for collisions, clearing lines, updating the score and level, adding sound effects and music, and implementing a game over condition.

The C# implementation uses the Unity or MonoGame framework, while the JavaScript implementation uses HTML5 Canvas. The Python implementation uses the Pygame library, and the Java implementation uses the Swing framework.

Feel free to explore the different implementations and compare the similarities and differences between the languages and frameworks used.

Getting Started
To run each implementation, follow the instructions in the corresponding directory.
